# Solving Google hashcode 2021 pizza problem by a newbie 
Program is in progress.

This script is my new and first repository to improve my skills in Python, Git, NumPy and Pandas.
Hope you enjoy my beginner project :-)

Feel free to contact me for improvements.


# About the script 
This script solves the Google hashcode 2021 pizza problem, if you are not familiar with the problem please read the pdf first.

# Solving strategy
Step 1: Read string input and convert to dataframe, if there are more pizzas than team members, compress dataframe    

Step 2: Generate random combinations of pizzas. Score them and extract the best combinations into a new dataframe.

Step 3: Repeat step 2 until there are no more pizzas.

Step 4: Convert the new dataframe to a string and generate a solution file.

The solution file can be validated using the validate.py script

# Coming updates

- More precision for a better solution
- a bash script to run this program and validate via terminal
